# Progress
I will be charting my learning progress here.

- I began the course yesterday and have made decent ground so far. I am done with the majority of the beginning sections, which included information on JS data types, operators, loops, conditions, functions, etc.
- In section 7 of the course, Jonas began teaching DOM manipulation. He showed the final state of a small project that he'd build for teaching DOM. 
- Before seeing his code, I took it as an exercise to build the project by myself. I did so successfully and have created a Repo for it named 'Guess My Number! - Small JS Project'.

- I already have some basic familiarity with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I have bought Jonas Schmedtmann's Javascript course on Udemy, and will be following it for a while.
- I will be doing its exercises, its projects (with my own modifications if possible) and will try to come up with new projects that are similar to the course projects for practice.
- It's a long course. Let's begin!
