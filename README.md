# Progress
I will be charting my learning progress here.

<em> 5th January 2024 </em>
- Made more headway. Learned about more advanced DOM, which included event propagation (bubbling, capturing, etc.), traversal, etc. Also learned about the Intersection Observer API.
- Then, learned about Object-oriented Programming (OOP) in JS. Got to know about prototypes, prototypal inheritance, chaining, constructor functions, ES6 classes and Object.create().
- Learned about Promises and Async-await.
- With all of this, I have finished 17 sections of this 18-section course by Jonas. The final section involves building a complete and complex modern JS application which will use all of the concepts 
that have been covered so far. I will code along with Jonas, and will try to understand everything along the way. I'm sure it'll be a good, dense learning experience.

<em> 15th December 2023 </em>
- Got busy with college work but still managed to cover a lot more ground in the course. Got done with multiple sections and also coded along a nice, minimalist banking application.
- Section 8 of the course consisted of understanding some behind-the-scenes Javascript fundamentals, which included the JS Engine and Runtime, the call stack, scoping, etc.
- Thereafter in section 9, I learned about some data structures and modern operators. For example, I learned more about arrays and the spread operator along with various array methods such as map, filter, reduce, etc.
- Jonas also taught about Dates and timers.
- Throughout these sections (up till section 12), as more and more JS features were introduced, more and more corresponding functionality was added to the previously mentioned banking application. I have 
created a repository for the final code of the app. It is a simple, single-page, minimalist banking application, having several features such as log-in, transfering money, requesting loan, closing an account, 
displaying of money movements, a time-out timer, etc. I coded along Jonas and learned how every JS concept he taught was applied to this application. It was a thorough, dense and clear learning experience.

<em> 27th November 2023 </em>
- I began the course yesterday and have made decent ground so far. I am done with the majority of the beginning sections, which included information on JS data types, operators, loops, conditions, functions, etc.
- In section 7 of the course, Jonas began teaching DOM manipulation. He showed the final state of a small project that he'd build for teaching DOM. 
- Before seeing his code, I took it as an exercise to build the project by myself. I did so successfully and have created a Repo for it named 'Guess My Number! - Small JS Project'.

<em> 26th November 2023 </em> 
- I already have some basic familiarity with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I have bought Jonas Schmedtmann's Javascript course on Udemy, and will be following it for a while.
- I will be doing its exercises, its projects (with my own modifications if possible) and will try to come up with new projects that are similar to the course projects for practice.
- It's a long course. Let's begin!
