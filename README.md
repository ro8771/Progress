I will be charting my learning progress here.

- I already have some basic familiarity with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I have bought Jonas Schmedtmann's Javascript course on Udemy, and will be following it for a while.
- I will be doing its exercises, its projects (with my own modifications if possible) and will try to come up with new projects that are similar to the course projects for practice.
- It's a long course. Let's begin!
